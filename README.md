# 2023_02_data_and_file_management_using_R
An introduction to Data and File Management using R

This workshop covers basic but the essential steps to read, understand and visualise the data before
performing any downstream task. This hands-on training consists of learning R packages and functions to
import the data from various file formats or sources and cleaning and reshaping the data, followed by data
summarisation and manipulation. At the end, we go through the different data visualisation techniques
using ggplot2. The workshop will give the participants an opportunity to learn some of the strongest and
widely used data manipulation and visualisation R packages such as Dplyr, Tidyverse and ggplot2.
