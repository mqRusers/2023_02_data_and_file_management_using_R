# 2023_02_data_and_file_management_using_R
An introduction to Data and File Management using R

This workshop covers basic but the essential steps to read, understand and visualise the data before
performing any downstream task. This hands-on training consists of learning R packages and functions to
import the data from various file formats or sources and cleaning and reshaping the data, followed by data
summarisation and manipulation. At the end, we go through the different data visualisation techniques
using ggplot2. The workshop will give the participants an opportunity to learn some of the strongest and
widely used data manipulation and visualisation R packages such as Dplyr, Tidyverse and ggplot2.


Presenter: 
 
Dr Zainab Noor is a Senior Research Officer in ProCan at Childrenâ€™s Medical Research Institute. She acquired her Ph.D. in Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences from Macquarie University, Sydney. Her previous research focused on cancer proteomics, specifically the application of bioinformatics and data science techniques to explore novel or little-known proteins in human cancer. 
  
Dr Zainab has expertise in bioinformatics, cancer research, proteomics data analysis and data science. Currently, at ProCan, she is performing large-scale multi-omics analysis using proteomics and transcriptomics datasets, and bioinformatics analysis on paediatric and adult cancers to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 


The recording of the workshop will be uploaded here soon.
