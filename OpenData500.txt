We are proud to be part of the industry that is helping to fight corrosion. We manufacture Galvanic Anodes. High quality (ISO 9001 accredited by LRQA), fast turn around and competitively priced. 

Our anodes protect billions of dollars worth of infrastructure around Australia, the South Pacific and South East Asia including industrial anodes for offshore oil rigs, floating FPSOs, mining, construction and pipelines as well as for the protection of infrastructure such as ports, wharves, sheet pile walls and desalination plants. Our anodes also protect ships, yachts, marine motors, tanks and hot water systems.

Since commencing manufacturing in 1984, we have established ourselves as Australia’s largest galvanic anode manufacturer. Our foundry is designed based on Lean Manufacturing principals, where work flow efficiency gains and minimal down time has lead to significantly shorter lead times and reduced energy use.

An integral part of our commitment to providing high quality anodes is our laboratories which include an Optical Emission Spectrometer for chemical analysis, electrochemical test baths, anode-to-core resistance testing and more.

We can cast these anodes for around $5-$8 each. We were not able to get the chemical analysis of the anodes from DOD or a sample which we could analyse in our lab to identify the chemical composition, so we are missing out on this work.

Our businesses have helped people recover from natural disasters, accidents and loss since 1851. We employ more than 15,000 people in our operations in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Vietnam, providing insurance under many leading brands, including NRMA Insurance, CGU, SGIO, SGIC, Swann, WFI and Lumley Insurance (Australia); NZI, State, AMI and Lumley Insurance (New Zealand); Safety and NZI (Thailand); and AAA Assurance (Vietnam).  We also have interests in general insurance joint ventures in Malaysia, India and China.

Last year, we insured $1,420 billion worth of assets on behalf of millions of customers, and we paid $6,898 million in claims.

Increasingly, we see our role extending beyond paying claims to increasing awareness of risk, and helping communities reduce and prevent risk. We believe it is our responsibility as an industry leader to use our influence and role as a major investor, purchaser and employer for the good of everyone.

However whilst data is generally available in a usable form, in some circumstances the datasets are incomplete (e.g. flood data), or a web service is unavailable or performs poorly (e.g. some Geoscience Australia services).  It would be beneficial to see these issues resolved.
A lack of completeness of metadata for all open (and closed) datasets created by Government or with government funding also creates issues. Finding and understanding what data is available at all levels of government is complex and time-consuming. Duplication and inefficiency in many datasets created by all levels of government is commonplace. It would be ideal to have more coordination, transparency and governance by the various governments to identify owners, creators and the locations of all open datasets and the research that creates them.  https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/B-1hCJyBZ6twxLzPtwbpNV?domain=data.gov.au facilitates this to some degree, but missing datasets & metadata limits its usefulness.
Regarding geospatial web services it would be good if more spatial data was available as standards based vector web services such as GeoJSON or WFS this would allow for example dynamic analysis of the weather as well as visualisation.  Most spatial web services are currently WMS based, which only allows for visualisation."	"IAG uses natural hazard and census demographic information to improve their understanding of risk.  This, in turn, allows IAG to provide premiums that accurately and fairly represent a customer's risk.  As part of this, IAG uses a significant amount of natural hazard flood data from many sources at the local and state government levels.

IAG uses natural hazard and weather information to get a clearer understanding of the impact of a major event, such as a cyclone, bushfire or flood, before, during and after they strike.  This allows IAG to scale their major event response rapidly to help affected customers recover from the event quickly, as well as notify our business partners, such as reinsurers, and the share market of the impact.

IAG also has specialised teams with advanced analytics capabilities who use census demographics to deliver market leading insights to enhance and constantly improve the customer experience.
"	"Cost efficiency', 'New or improved product/service', 'Revenue growth'"	"National, consistent natural hazards datasets:  Whilst IAG currently uses some natural hazards open data � its typically delivered in disparate datasets, is of varying quality and doesn�t always adhere to a standard.  Having national, consistent datasets would allow governments, business and the community to use the data more readily and to better understand the risks.
Emergency response datasets: Access to emergency response data, real-time and post-event, would allow IAG to gain a more immediate and clearer view of an event�s impact.  This would allow IAG to help its affected customers faster and provide more certainty to our business partners (e.g. reinsurers) and shareholders.
Building attributes: To understand the risk of natural perils and non-natural perils (e.g. burglary) at a more granular level, as well as provide customers a better experience through a simpler quoting process and to avoid underinsurance:  a better understanding of the assets IAG insures is needed.
Examples of building attribute data required includes:  construction type, number of bedrooms & high-resolution elevation data. GA�s NEXIS dataset, currently unavailable to non-government users due to licensing, is a good example of this.
Motor Vehicle data: Access to de-identified motor vehicle registration data and accident data would be beneficial to reducing risk in the community.  Registration data would allow IAG to better identify individual motor vehicles and simplify the quoting process. Granular Accident data would allow IAG�s advanced analytics teams to identify blackspots to drive a public education program to inform drivers of the potential risk for accidents in their local area."

I would like to see more effort from Australia to collaborate with other international Jurisdictions on the standards for key datasets that economically and socially describe good Government. Foreign aid agreements could then include an open data clause to ensure transparent reporting on spending activities, as per agreed international standards. 
I would like to see more program and policy development being integrated with data event capture so that iterative policy and program refinement can occur based on near real time data. 
I would like to see Government working more closely with industry to help coordinate open data opportunities that will improve those industries with regard to transparency, participation with stakeholders and collaboration within the value chain.
